Not long after "Ben":http://www.techbelly.com persuaded me to join the fledgling "Reevoo":http://www.reevoo.com, we got our first big ReevooMark partners ("Dixons":http://www.dixons.co.uk & "Currys":http://www.currys.co.uk) live. To celebrate this event and my having left Java behind at "Thoughtworks":http://www.thoughtworks.co.uk, Ben bought me a "Java Rehabilitation Clinic mug":http://www.cafepress.com/javarehab.29832584. The mug has recently developed a crack. I wonder if it's trying to tell me it's time to learn another language...
