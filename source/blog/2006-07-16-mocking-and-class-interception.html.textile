While developing "Mocha":http://rubyforge.org/projects/mocha, I have to admit I've been somewhat remiss in keeping up-to-date with the latest developments on projects like "RSpec":http://rspec.rubyforge.org and "FlexMock":http://onestepback.org/software/flexmock. It looks like both projects have gone further than Mocha with implementing the JMock concepts. FlexMock also now supports simple class interception (see FlexMock::TestCase#intercept), but it admits to being "very simple-minded", has "a number of restrictions" and "a proxy class constant will be left behind".

I don't think Stubba suffers from these limitations, but I'll save a more detailed explanation for another post. It doesn't look like either project has anything like AutoMocha.
