Just to prove that I can now blog[1] from "Flickr":http://www.flickr.com/ to my "blog":/blog - hurrah!

I was seeing this error in my Typo log...

bc. undefined method `include?' for nil:NilClass
....cgi_ext/cgi_methods.rb:49:in `parse_request_parameters'

p. Having found "these":http://www.typosphere.org/trac/ticket/538 "bug reports":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/5137, I applied "this patch":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/attachment/ticket/4955/rails-parse-request-parameters-with-nil-key.patch and all seems to be well.

fn1. In the end I doctored the awful html generated by flickr.
