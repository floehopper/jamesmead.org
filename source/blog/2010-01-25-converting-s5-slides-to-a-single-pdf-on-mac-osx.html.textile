I used "S5":http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/ in combination with "Webby":http://webby.rubyforge.org/ for my "Ruby & Cocoa presentation":/talks/2009-12-14-ruby-and-cocoa-at-ruby-manor/ at "RubyManor":http://rubymanor.org/harder/. I hate PowerPoint with a passion and haven't done enough presentations to be bothered to learn KeyNote. So I was much happier generating my slides from a plain text file marked up in "Textile":http://redcloth.org/textile.

However, like "Paul Battley":http://po-ru.com/diary/how-to-convert-an-s5-presentation-to-images/, I found that S5 doesn't work so well when someone wants to take those slides and put them in a video. Anyway, I've managed to convert my S5 slides into a single PDF using a combination of "@webkit2png@":http://www.paulhammond.org/webkit2png/ and a custom "Automator":http://www.apple.com/macosx/what-is-macosx/apps-and-utilities.html#automator workflow :-

h2. Ruby Script using @webkit2png@

bc(prettyprint).. #!/usr/bin/env ruby

NUMBER_OF_SLIDES = 94
SEQUENCE_FORMAT = "%0#{Math.log10(NUMBER_OF_SLIDES).to_i}d"
HOST = "jamesmead.local"
PATH = "/talks/2009-12-14-ruby-and-cocoa-at-ruby-manor/"
BASE_URL = "http://#{HOST}#{PATH}"

(0...NUMBER_OF_SLIDES).each do |index|
  anchor = "#slide#{index}"
  url = "#{BASE_URL}#{anchor}"
  sequence = SEQUENCE_FORMAT % index
  puts %x[webkit2png --fullsize --filename=slide-#{sequence} #{url}]
  raise unless $?.success?
end
