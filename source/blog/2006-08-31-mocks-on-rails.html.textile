It's great to see that "Gluttonous":http://glu.ttono.us/ has been playing with "Mocha":http://gofreerange.com/mocha/docs/. Like many people, he's found the ability to mock or stub class methods particularly useful - and this is one of the key differentiators between "Mocha":http://gofreerange.com/mocha/docs/ and other Ruby "mocking":http://onestepback.org/software/flexmock/ "libraries":http://rspec.rubyforge.org/.

He's been trying to improve the test coverage for "Rails":http://www.rubyonrails.org/ and submitted "this patch":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/5970 where there is an interesting discussion[1] about why he would prefer to use "Mocha":http://gofreerange.com/mocha/docs/. Interestingly, there has also been some recent "discussion":http://rubyforge.org/pipermail/rspec-devel/2006-August/000548.html on the "RSpec":http://rspec.rubyforge.org/ mailing list about adding Mocha-like functionality.

On a different note, in his article "Mocks for Speed":http://glu.ttono.us/articles/2006/08/30/mocks-for-speed, Gluttonous draws attention to one of the advantages I have "previously mentioned":/blog/2006-06-27-rails-fixtures-help-or-hindrance of using mocks extensively to write unit tests that test a class in isolation - namely a fast build.

fn1. We have now released Mocha under the MIT license so it can be used for testing within Rails.
