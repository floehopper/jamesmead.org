h2. Selling Privately

We're planning on moving to Oxford this summer and so we're putting our "house in Durham":http://durham-house-for-sale.co.uk/ on the market. At the moment we're looking to sell the house privately without an estate agent, so if you know anyone who might be interested, please contact us.

We're also interested to hear about people's experience with on-line "low cost" estate agents like "eMoov":http://www.emoov.co.uk/, "House Network":http://www.housenetwork.co.uk/, "HouseWeb":http://www.houseweb.co.uk/, etc.

And if anyone has any ideas for good places to advertise, we're all ears!

h3. Update

We decided to go with "eMoov":http://www.emoov.co.uk/. I'll let you know how we get on.
