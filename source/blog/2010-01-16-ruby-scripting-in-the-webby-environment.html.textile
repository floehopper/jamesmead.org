As I mentioned in my "previous post":/blog/2010-01-14-ruby-wrapper-for-the-delicious-v2-api-using-the-oauth-gem, I'm in the process of converting my blog from being a Rails app using "Typo":http://www.typosphere.org/ to being a static site generated by "Webby":http://webby.rubyforge.org/.

I've found myself wanting to be able to write Ruby scripts with access to the Webby "environment" e.g. the @@pages@ instance variable.

I couldn't find any documentation about this, so with a bit of delving into the source code and a bit of experimentation, I came up with the following code. I thought I'd share it here in case it was of use to anyone else. And if anyone knows a better way of doing it, please let me know.

_Note that I think this script has to run at the top level of the project._

bc(prettyprint).. require 'webby'

# load Sitefile, setup load path
main = Webby::Apps::Main.new
main.init([])
main.app.init 'webby'
main.app.load_rakefile

# load helpers
include BlogHelper
include UrlHelper

# load pages, layouts, etc.
builder = Webby::Builder.new
builder.load_files
@pages = Webby::Resources.pages
