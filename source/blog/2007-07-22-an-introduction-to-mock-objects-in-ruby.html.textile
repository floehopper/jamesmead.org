As "promised":/blog/2007-07-10-lrug-mocking-talk I've finally got round to making the "S5":http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/ slides of my "LRUG talk":http://www.lrug.org/meetings/2007/06/20/july-2007-meeting/ available "here":/talks/2007-07-09-introduction-to-mock-objects-in-ruby-at-lrug/.

You can use "various keys":http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/features.html#controlchart to navigate the presentation. If you just want to quickly scan through the content, you might find the outline view useful (press the "T" key to toggle between slideshow & outline modes).
