So thanks to "Kev Clark's":https://web.archive.org/web/20080714205940/http://glu.ttono.us/ interest and hard work, it looks like "Mocha":https://mocha.jamesmead.org/ is being used to improve test coverage in some of the "Rails":http://www.rubyonrails.org/ frameworks - take a look at this "patch":https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/f6339eb17710ce81117e06725a4403e33a934d24.
