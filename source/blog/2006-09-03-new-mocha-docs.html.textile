Spurred on by "Thorsten's comment":https://web.archive.org/web/20080630064341/http://glu.ttono.us/articles/2006/09/02/mocking-models#comment-1106 on "Kevin Clark's blog":https://web.archive.org/web/20080714205940/http://glu.ttono.us/ and a mention of "Mocha":https://mocha.jamesmead.org/ in the "Top 5 Rails Stories of the Week":http://cleanair.highgroove.com/articles/2006/09/03/ruby_on_rails_enterprise_capistrano_mocked_models_class_variables_rest, I've given the Mocha "documentation":https://mocha.jamesmead.org/ a major overhaul.

Now the "RDoc":http://rdoc.sourceforge.net/ only shows the public API which should hopefully improve the signal-to-noise ratio and show how simple it is to use.

* "Create traditional mock objects":https://web.archive.org/web/20061012051729/http://mocha.rubyforge.org/classes/Mocha/AutoVerify.html
* "Set expectations on traditional mock objects":https://web.archive.org/web/20061012051726/http://mocha.rubyforge.org/classes/Mocha/MockMethods.html
* "Set expectations on real (non-mock) classes":https://web.archive.org/web/20061012051712/http://mocha.rubyforge.org/classes/Object.html
* "Make expectations more specific or define behaviour of stub":https://web.archive.org/web/20061012051703/http://mocha.rubyforge.org/classes/Mocha/Expectation.html

I've also had a play with "CodeRay":http://coderay.rubychan.de/ and generated syntax-highlighted examples.
* "Quick Start":https://mocha.jamesmead.org/index.html#quick-start
* "Traditional mocking":https://mocha.jamesmead.org/index.html#mock-objects
* "Setting expectations on real (non-mock) classes":https://mocha.jamesmead.org/index.html#partial-mocking

Good general information on mocking...
