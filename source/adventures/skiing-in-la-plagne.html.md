Travel by Eurostar overnight snow train - ski on first afternoon

Subject: Ski La Plagne: Yay!

OK, I'll hit you with the good news....

we have a chalet, all to ourselves reserved, on reservation. It's in Plagne Village (which I've been to before: it's pretty). No pictures of the chalet but almost identical to (and run by the same people) as Chalet India: see

http://www.laplagnechalets.co.uk/chalet_details.asp?cid=417

It's "ski in ski out", which means you don't even need to walk anywhere. Ever! So, perhaps a little trip to the Sno-Dome may be in order for some so you can actually leave the house on Sunday morning... There is ski rental in the village, I believe, so there may be a teensy bit of walking for some. I'll check on lessons later: they may be in the village or up one lift to Plagne 2000 (this is based on 1988, it may have changed).

OK, the bad news is that we didn't get the one I hoped for (Alexander) which was £375. This will be £420. For which you get all the food listed at the end of the email. NOTE: group bookings can upgrade to posh nosh... to think about, possibly.

So here's the softener. If the 420 is a serious difficulty to anyone, please get back to me by email and we will come up with a solution, because I want to go and don't want to be a saddo no-mates.

The only teeny little difference from India is that one of the twin rooms does NOT have en suite. Well, hot damn and blast. So, I'm more than happy to have that one as one thing I can't stand is being woken up by someone peeing like a horse 4 feet from my head at 3 am...

What else: check IN is 2 pm Saturday. OUT is 10 am Saturday, but we can dump bags at the chalet, apparently. This might be useful.

So, "Do We Stay or Do We Go"

We went through about 8 chalets to get to this one, all full or 1/2 full. This is a good offer (some quids off for not having en suite!), in a nice place with varied night-life stuff and I recommend we go for it.

I have "wot ever" confirmation from Anna (as she's away today). Can I please have confirmations either way asap.
