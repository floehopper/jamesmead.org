We'll have both our mobiles with us, but I'm not sure how good the signal will be and there's no electricity in the cabin for charging!

Molly & Jim own the cabin and have a house in Albuquerque where we'll be
staying on the night we arrive and the night before leaving.

We'll be skiing at the Taos ski resort
