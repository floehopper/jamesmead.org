Here's our flight details assuming Gatwick isn't snowed in by Friday!

London (LGW) Depart 10:15 to Dallas (DFW) Arrive 14:25 - Flight AA51
Dallas (DFW) Depart 15:50 to Albuquerque (ABQ) Arrive 16:38 - Flight

AA1802
Dallas (DFW) Depart 17:05 to London (LGW) Arrive 07:45 +1 day - Flight

We'll have both our mobiles with us, but I'm not sure how good the signal will be and there's no electricity in the cabin for charging!

Molly & Jim own the cabin and have a house in Albuquerque where we'll be
staying on the night we arrive and the night before leaving.

We'll be skiing at the Taos ski resort
