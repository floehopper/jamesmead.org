h2. Release Notes

* Added "mocha.gemspec":http://github.com/floehopper/mocha/tree/master/mocha.gemspec file generated with "Chad Woolley's":http://www.thewoolleyweb.com/ new rake task, so that a "floehopper-mocha gem":http://gems.github.com/list.html will get built on "GitHub":http://github.com.
* Add rake task to update "mocha.gemspec":http://github.com/floehopper/mocha/tree/master/mocha.gemspec with unique version, which will cause gem to be auto-built on GitHub.
* As Tobias Crawley correctly pointed out in feature request #23055 "stubs(with_hash) not working with existing object":http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=23055&group_id=1917&atid=7480, following the principle of least surprise, it should be possible to call "ObjectMethods#expects":http://mocha.rubyforge.org/classes/Mocha/ObjectMethods.html#M000007 & "ObjectMethods#stubs":http://mocha.rubyforge.org/classes/Mocha/ObjectMethods.html#M000008 with a Hash of method_names vs return_values like you can with "Mock#expects":http://mocha.rubyforge.org/classes/Mocha/Mock.html#M000049 & "Mock#stubs":http://mocha.rubyforge.org/classes/Mocha/Mock.html#M000050. I've also updated & improved the docs to reflect the changes.
* Removed deprecated gem autorequire.
