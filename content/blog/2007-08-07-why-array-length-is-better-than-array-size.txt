keywords: array ruby size length machine representation bug

Recently "Luke":http://www.lukeredpath.co.uk/ and I spotted a subtle bug in our code where we were mistakenly assuming a method returned an @Array@ when it actually returned a @Fixnum@. We were then calling the @#size@ method on the result, but interestingly "@Fixnum#size@":http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Fixnum.html#M001098 returns the number of bytes in its machine representation.

Previously I had noticed that my colleague "Paul Battley":http://po-ru.com/ tended to use "@Array#length@":http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Array.html#M002199 in preference to "@Array#size@":http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Array.html#M002244. Now I know why, or at least I know why I'm going to start using @Array#length@! If we'd used @#length@ in this case we would have seen a @NoMethodError@ instead of the spurious value, 4.

bc(ruby)..   [5,6].size # => 2
  1.size # => 4
  [5,6].length # => 2
  1.length # => NoMethodError: undefined method `length' for 1:Fixnum
