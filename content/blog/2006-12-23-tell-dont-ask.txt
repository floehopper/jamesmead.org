Following on from a couple of my "previous":http://blog.floehopper.org/articles/2006/12/23/fixtures-mock-objects-or-in-memory-activerecord-objects "posts":http://blog.floehopper.org/articles/2006/12/23/stub-queries-and-expect-commands, here are some more comments on the "Making a Mockery of ActiveRecord":http://metaclass.org/2006/12/22/making-a-mockery-of-activerecord article...

Something that may be adding unnecessary complexity to the test is that the @Message#generate@ method knows the structure of objects for which it does not have direct references. For example, it looks like the @List@ and @Person@ instances are supplied, just so that the @generate@ method can navigate to the @subscriptions@ in order to call @create@. This breaks the "Law of Demeter":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter.

A first step to improving the design would be to have a @List#create_subscriptions@ method which would be called by @Message#generate@. We could then simplify the unit test as follows...

<typo:code lang="ruby">
  def test_should_create_email_messages_and_subscriptions_when_include_subscribers_is_true
    list = mock()
    campaign = Campaign.new(:people => [])
    message = Message.new(:campaign => campaign)
    message.stubs(:lists).returns([list])
    message.include_subscribers = true

    list.expects(:create_subscriptions)

    message.generate
    assert_equal 1, message.email_messages
  end
</typo:code>

Obviously we'd need to add a separate unit test for the @List#create_subscriptions@ method, but that would also be much simpler and easier to understand. In this way we have decoupled @Message@ from the structure of @List@ and are just relying on its behaviour. "Nat Pryce":http://nat.truemesh.com/ & "Steve Freeman":http://stevef.truemesh.com/ call this the "??Tell Don't Ask?? style":http://www.mockobjects.com/2006/10/tell-dont-ask-and-mock-objects.html.

Finally, I prefer not to have much more than "one assertion per test":http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=35578 (and don't forget verifying an expectation is effectively an assertion), so I'd probably split the test into two - one to verify @create_subscriptions@ was called and one to check the @email_messages@ were created.
