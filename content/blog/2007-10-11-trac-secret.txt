We've been using "Trac":http://trac.edgewall.org/ at "Reevoo":http://www.reevoo.com since I joined the company over 2 years ago. In the main, I've been pretty happy with it - it's not fancy, but it does basic stuff tolerably well. However, I've always found it annoying that I couldn't easily find a file/directory which I know used to be in our "Subversion":http://subversion.tigris.org/ repository, but has been deleted.

I'm sure most people already know about the following feature of Trac, but just in case it's useful to somebody else...

A couple of days ago, I had a small "aha" moment, when I decided to actually read an error page that Trac produces if you try to hack the "browse" url to navigate to your deleted file...

You see something like the following...

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jamesthecat/1542684116/" title="TracInternalError by floehopper, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2212/1542684116_590a106b22.jpg" width="500" height="260" alt="TracInternalError" /></a>

My attention has always been drawn to the line of highlighted text, which indicates that the file has not been found, but the line underneath includes a link to "search in the repository history to see if that path existed but was later removed". If I click that link, lo and behold...

I can now see the directory I was looking for and its history, including the changeset in which it was deleted. What's more, it has a nice "hackable":http://urls.inelegant.org/hackable/ url...

The moral of the story is that you should always read error messages carefully!
