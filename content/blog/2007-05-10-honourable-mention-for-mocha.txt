I just downloaded an updated version of the Pragmatic Bookshelf's "Agile Web Development with Rails":http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/ book. Maybe it's been there a while, but I just noticed "Mocha":http://gofreerange.com/mocha/docs/ is mentioned at the end of the chapter on testing. :-)
