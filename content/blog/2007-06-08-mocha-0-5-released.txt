bc(prettyprint). sudo gem install mocha

or "download":http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=1917 one of the latest packages from "rubyforge":http://rubyforge.org.

h3. Parameter Matchers

I've added a few "Hamcrest-style":http://code.google.com/p/hamcrest/wiki/Tutorial parameter matchers which are designed to be used inside "@Expectation#with@":http://mocha.rubyforge.org/classes/Mocha/Expectation.html#M000021. The following matchers are currently available: @anything()@, @includes()@, @has_key()@, @has_value()@, @has_entry()@, @all_of()@ & @any_of()@. More to follow soon. The idea is eventually to get rid of the nasty @parameter_block@ option on "@Expectation#with@":http://mocha.rubyforge.org/classes/Mocha/Expectation.html#M000021.

bc(prettyprint). object = mock()
object.expects(:method).with(has_key('key_1'))
object.method('key_1' => 1, 'key_2' => 2)
# no verification error raised

bc(prettyprint). object = mock()
object.expects(:method).with(has_key('key_1'))
object.method('key_2' => 2)
# verification error raised, because method was not called with Hash containing key: 'key_1'

h3. Values Returned and Exceptions Raised on Consecutive Invocations

Allow multiple calls to "@Expectation#returns@":http://mocha.rubyforge.org/classes/Mocha/Expectation.html#M000024 and "@Expectation#raises@":http://mocha.rubyforge.org/classes/Mocha/Expectation.html#M000025 to build up a sequence of responses to invocations on the mock. Added syntactic sugar method @Expectation#then@ to allow more readable expectations. 

bc(prettyprint). object = mock()
object.stubs(:method).returns(1, 2).then.raises(Exception).then.returns(4)
object.method # => 1
object.method # => 2
object.method # => raises exception of class Exception
object.method # => 4

h3. Yields on Consecutive Invocations

Allow multiple calls to yields on single expectation to allow yield parameters to be specified for consecutive invocations.

bc(prettyprint). object = mock()
object.stubs(:method).yields(1, 2).then.yields(3)
object.method { |*values| p values } # => [1, 2]
object.method { |*values| p values } # => [3]

h3. Multiple Yields on Single Invocation

Added "@Expectation#multiple_yields@":http://mocha.rubyforge.org/classes/Mocha/Expectation.html#M000023 to allow a mocked or stubbed method to yield multiple times for a single invocation.

bc(prettyprint). object = mock()
object.stubs(:method).multiple_yields([1, 2], [3])
object.method { |*values| p values } # => [1, 2] # => [3]

h3. Invocation Dispatch

Expectations were already being matched in reverse order i.e. the most recently defined one was being found first. This is still the case, but we now stop matching an expectation when its maximum number of expected invocations is reached. c.f. "JMock v1":http://www.jmock.org/jmock1-dispatch.html. A stub will never stop matching by default. Hopefully this means we can soon get rid of the need to pass a @Proc@ to "@Expectation#returns@":http://mocha.rubyforge.org/classes/Mocha/Expectation.html#M000024.

bc(prettyprint). object = mock()
object.stubs(:method).returns(2)
object.expects(:method).once.returns(1)
object.method # => 1
object.method # => 2
object.method # => 2
# no verification error raised

This should still work...

bc(prettyprint). Time.stubs(:now).returns(Time.parse('Mon Jan 01 00:00:00 UTC 2007'))
Time.now # => Mon Jan 01 00:00:00 UTC 2007
Time.stubs(:now).returns(Time.parse('Thu Feb 01 00:00:00 UTC 2007'))
Time.now # => Thu Feb 01 00:00:00 UTC 2007
