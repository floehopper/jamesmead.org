h2. Release Notes

* Added explicit support for "MiniTest":https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest v1.5.0 to v2.0.2.
* Make testable by "rubygems-test":https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems-test. Mocha results posted "here":http://gem-testers.org/gems/mocha.
* Added a "URI parameter matcher":http://mocha.rubyforge.org/classes/Mocha/ParameterMatchers.html#M000025 that ignores the order of query parameters so that tests can be independent of undefined hash ordering (patch by "Paul Battley":http://po-ru.com/).
* Include unexpected invocation in failure message and change the language slightly to make the failure message less confusing. See "this Lighthouse ticket":http://floehopper.lighthouseapp.com/projects/22289/tickets/52 for details.
* No need to create regular expression every time the @BacktraceFilter#filtered@ method is called. See "this Lighthouse ticket":http://floehopper.lighthouseapp.com/projects/22289-mocha/tickets/66 for details.
* Update links to my blog and make other links consistent.
