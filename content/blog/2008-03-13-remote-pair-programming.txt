A while ago, "Chris":http://blog.seagul.co.uk/ mentioned that "we've been trying out a few ideas":http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2007/09/29/monitoring-the-mac-osx-filesystem-with-ruby for making remote "pair-programming":http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/pair.html easier. We've been doing quite a bit more remote pairing recently. Most of the time we just use a combination of "VNC":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VNC (I've been using "Vine Server":http://www.redstonesoftware.com/products/vine/server/vineosx/index.html) and voice over "Skype":http://www.skype.com/ (using a headset really helps).

But something else we've used successfully is multi-user "GNU screen":http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/ sessions. The advantage of this technique is that much less bandwidth is required and the terminal is much more responsive. I thought I'd post the magic incantation we've been using (on "OSX":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X), in case anyone else finds it useful...

bc. # on the server
sudo chmod u+s /usr/bin/screen

bc. # first user connects to server over ssh and runs the following
screen -S <session_name>
ctrl-A :multiuser on
ctrl-A :acladd <client_username>

bc. # second user connects to server over ssh and runs the following
screen -x <server_username>/<session_name>
