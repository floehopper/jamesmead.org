* Added @Mocha::ObjectMethods#unstub@ method - see "GitHub issue":https://github.com/freerange/mocha/issues/6.
* Inherit @Mocha::ExpectationError@ from @Exception@ instead of @StandardError@ to reduce the chances of a test passing by accident - thanks to "James Sanders":http://github.com/jsanders - see "GitHub issue":https://github.com/freerange/mocha/issues/15
* Fixed "bug":https://github.com/freerange/mocha/issues/11 - GitHub README page to link correctly to code examples
* Fixed "bug":https://github.com/freerange/mocha/issues/14 - @PASSTHROUGH_EXCEPTIONS@ are defined on @MiniTest::Unit::TestCase@ not in @Mocha@ - thanks to "Brian Troutwine":http://github.com/blt
