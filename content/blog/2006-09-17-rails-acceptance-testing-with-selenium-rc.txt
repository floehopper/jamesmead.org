My colleague "Ben":http://www.reevoo.com/blogs/bengriffiths/ has just published a "Rails plugin":http://rubyforge.org/projects/inbrowsertest/  which should simplify setting up "Selenium Remote Control":http://www.openqa.org/selenium-rc/ to run acceptance tests for your "Rails":http://www.rubyonrails.com/ app. So read "his article":http://www.reevoo.com/blogs/bengriffiths/2006/09/17/simple-selenium-testing-with-rails/ and give it a whirl.

Selenium tests run directly in the browser. You can run the same Selenium test against different browsers e.g. for browser compatability testing (all mainstream JavaScript-enabled browsers are supported). You can also use Selenium to test Ajax-based web applications. If you're not familiar with Selenium, have a "read about it":http://www.openqa.org/selenium-core/ and "watch some tests run":http://www.openqa.org/selenium-core/demos.html in your browser.

"Jason Huggins":http://www.jrandolph.com/blog/ gave a "talk":http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-594153467742593805 at the "London Test Automation Conference":http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/events/londontesters/speakers.html on recording screencast-style movies during execution of Selenium tests as a way to generate up-to-date documentation. I was interested, because we'd knocked a similar idea around the office a few weeks previously.

He tried to demo it as part of a "continuous integration":http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html setup with "CruiseControl":http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/. Unfortunately his ambitious demo, involving "Parallels Desktop":http://www.parallels.com/en/products/desktop/, multiple virtual machines, multiple operating systems, multiple languages & multiple browsers, didn't quite work during the talk itself, but I did see it working afterwards - it was pretty neat.
