Some time ago, my colleague "Chris":http://blog.seagul.co.uk recommended a book called "Maverick! The Success Story Behind the World's Most Unusual Workplace":http://www.amazon.com/Maverick-Success-Behind-Unusual-Workplace/dp/0446670553 by Ricardo Semler.

I found this book very inspiring. I don't normally go in for business school type books, but I found it readable and unpretentious. It strongly reminded me of Kent Beck's "Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change":http://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Change/dp/0321278658/  which talked about turning the dial up to 10 on common-sense practices.
