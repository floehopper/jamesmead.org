I thought I'd compare and contrast the way "Gluttonous":http://glu.ttono.us/ was "injecting mocks":http://glu.ttono.us/articles/2006/08/30/injecting-mocks-one-way-or-another and how you can do it with "Mocha":http://mocha.rubyforge.org.

*Gluttonous' way*

<typo:code lang="ruby">
  def test_process_exit
    delegate_methods_to_mock!(RailsFCGIHandler, :close_connection) do
      fcgi = flexmock()
      fcgi.should_receive(:close_connection)
      @handler.mock = fcgi
      @handler.stubs(:when_ready).returns(:exit)
      @handler.process!
    end
  end
</typo:code>

*Using Mocha*

<typo:code lang="ruby">
  def test_process_exit
    @handler.expects(:close_connection)
    @handler.stubs(:when_ready).returns(:exit)
    @handler.process!
  end
</typo:code>

I think it's a bit more readable and you don't need the block construction which starts becoming a nuisance when you need to stub methods on multiple classes.
