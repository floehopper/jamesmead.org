We have our own home-grown "continuous integration":http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html application at "work":http://www.reevoo.com, but a couple of weeks ago, I decided to have a go at getting "CruiseControl.rb":http://cruisecontrolrb.thoughtworks.com/ up and running at home for "Mocha":http://mocha.rubyforge.org. It all went pretty smoothly and I'm happy with the result. Thanks are due to the CruiseControl.rb "team":http://cruisecontrolrb.thoughtworks.com/documentation/team for clear instructions and a simple-to-use application.

I'd like to publish the url for my CruiseControl instance, but I'm concerned about random punters clicking the build button and loading my already creaking server, so a screenshot will have to suffice for now...

It would be nice if you only saw the build button if you were logged in. I feel a feature request coming on...

On a related note, it's great to see that there has been some effort going into getting a "RubyOnRails CruiseControl.rb instance":http://cruisecontrolrb.thoughtworks.com/builds/RubyOnRails/ set up.
