I keep forgetting how to do this, so I thought I'd write myself some notes.

In a recent version, "RubyGems":http://www.rubygems.org/ changed it's behaviour on @gem install@ so that if it doesn't have sufficient permission to install the gem files, it installs them in @~/.gem@ and generates a warning :-

bc. $ gem install <gem-name>
WARNING:  Installing to ~/.gem since /usr/local/ruby-1.8.6-p287/lib/ruby/gems/1.8 and
  /usr/local/ruby-1.8.6-p287/bin aren't both writable.
WARNING:  You don't have /Users/jamesmead/.gem/ruby/1.8/bin in your PATH,
  gem executables will not run.

Sometimes (e.g. when you forgot to prepend "@sudo@":http://developer.apple.com/DOCUMENTATION/DARWIN/Reference/ManPages/man8/sudo.8.html) this isn't what you want. However, it's not obvious how to uninstall the gem again to correct your mistake :-

bc. $ gem uninstall <gem-name>
ERROR:  While executing gem ... (Gem::InstallError)
  Unknown gem <gem-name> >= 0

To make this work, you need to specify the @install-dir@ option :-

bc. $ gem uninstall <gem-name> --install-dir=~/.gem/ruby/1.8/
Successfully uninstalled <gem-name>-x.y.z

Note that if you are using Ruby 1.9, it looks like the RubyGems directory path includes the point release version number e.g. @1.9.0@ or @1.9.1@.

*Update:* Prevention is better than cure. Coderr suggests "protecting your ~/.gem directory":http://coderrr.wordpress.com/2009/03/16/protecting-your-gem-directory/.
