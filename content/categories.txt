You're almost certainly here because you clicked a link on a search engine results page. That link was taking you to one of my 'category' pages: a page that contained all the posts in that category e.g.  http://blog.floehopper.org/articles/category/mocha_release. Like "Chris Roos":http://chrisroos.co.uk/tags, I didn't like these pages, because they're basically search results within search results. So I've got rid of them.

In the process of removing these category pages, I've tagged all my posts in "Delicious":http://delicious.com/ with the category, so that you can replicate the old 'category' pages. To do so, you'll need to search my bookmarks for the @jamesmead.org@ tag and whichever category it was that you were trying to visit e.g. to see all my posts in the @mocha_release@ category, you can visit "http://delicious.com/jamesmead/jamesmead.org+mocha_release":http://delicious.com/jamesmead/jamesmead.org+category:mocha_release (replace @mocha_release@ with the category you were trying to find).
