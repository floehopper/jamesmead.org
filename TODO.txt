tags - add tags to delicious and suggest search to user
tags xml feed e.g. /xml/atom/tag/apache/feed.xml
categories - maybe implement via tags - think mocha_release is only one
categories xml feed e.g. /xml/atom/category/mocha_release/feed.xml
year, month, day pages e.g. /articles/2009/ - suggest google site search
paginated pages e.g /articles/2009/page/2
navigation e.g. to presentations or blog index pages
favicon
consider removing xml suffix from feedburner.xml - need to check feedburner config anyway - maybe this should be in blog directory e.g. /blog/feed
ensure we have captured all urls in sitemap
why are links on blog index absolute?
do we need internal redirect for non-blog pages to avoid html suffix?
compression for Y-Slow
expiry for Y-Slow
syntax highlighting for code
export comments
disqus or equivalent for comments?
or abandon comments?
comments rss
credits e.g. powered by webby, thanks to chris roos, any layout/css stuff
automated deployment
howto publish new blog article
consider adding summaries (include on feeds) - add meta descriptions for each article/page
print stylesheet - remove navigation links, sidebar, etc
check in other browsers e.g. IE
png is better, but versions of IE will need gif (content negotiation?)
redirects for presentations to put date at the beginning of the url like articles
consider using typekit font like this http://typekit.com/fonts/494
consider moving tumblelog from tumble.floehopper.org --> life.jamesmead.org?
